This is a part of my practice project.
In this part, I am focusing on sharpen my TS skills along with using OOP concepts in TS and JS.

### `"npm start"`,

`npm start` can be use to start the project and see in local at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `"tsc -w"`,

`tsc -w` is strongly recommended to run on separate terminal (same directory) to keep the app compiling each time the code is save
